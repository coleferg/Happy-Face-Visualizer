# Happy-Face-Visualizer

This application allows you to use a MIDI controller to control an on screen visualizer. Your MIDI commands can be saved for accessing your animations later. You can also choose a song file from your computer that will be analysed for beat animation. An optional vocal track can be chosen to animate mouth movements.
