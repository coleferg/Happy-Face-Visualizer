# Personal-Project

Congratulations on making it through the first phase of Lambda School!  For this next phase you will be applying the concepts you learn in class to building a full stack application.  This application will be an important part of your portfolio so do your best work!  

## Project Requirements

* Must be a full-stack project.  Must have a back-end application and a client application.
* You must use the technologies that we teach you though you may add additional pieces that are outside of the curriculum.
* Work on making it functional before making it look pretty.
* Your web application must have multiple pages.
* Your application needs to have users.  There will be pages for registering and signing in and protected content.
* Other than these key points your project can be anything that you would like.
